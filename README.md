<!-- FrontEnd Features:
- React frontend with basic redux for state management and sagas for asynchronous calls
- Functionality: basic CRUD requirements and search, calendar display
- Unit tests for some redux actions, reducers, sagas, selectors.
- 3 routes: list, edit, add
- 3 components

Backend:
- Node.js/Express with basic routing -->
